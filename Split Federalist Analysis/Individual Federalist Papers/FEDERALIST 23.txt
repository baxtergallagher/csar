FEDERALIST 23 
The Necessity of a Government at Least Equally Energetic with the One Proposed 
by Alexander Hamilton   THE necessity of a Constitution, at least e qually energetic with the one proposed, to the 
preservation of the Union, is the point at the examination of which we are now arrived.   
 
This inquiry will naturally divide itself into three branches - the objects to be provided for by the 
federal government, the quantity of power necessary to the accomplishment of those objects, the persons upon whom that power ought to operate. Its distribution and organization will more properly claim our attention under the succeeding head.    
The principal purposes to be answered by union are these - the common defence of the members; 
the preservation of the public peace, as well agains t internal convulsions as external attacks; the 
regulation of commerce with other nations and between the States; the superintendence of our 
intercourse, political and commercial, with foreign countries.   
 
The authorities essential to the common defence are these: to raise armies; to build and equip fleets; 
to prescribe rules for the government of both; to direct their operations; to provide for their support. 
These powers ought to exist without limitation, because  it is impossible to foresee or define the 
extent and variety of national exigencies, or the correspondent extend and variety of the means 
which may be necessary to satisfy them. The circumstances that endanger the safety of nations are 
infinite, and for this reason no constitutional sh ackles can wisely be imposed on the power to which 
the care of it is committed. This power ought to be co-extensive with all the possible combinations of such circumstances; and ought to be under the direction of the same councils which are appointed 
to preside over the common defence.   
 
This is one of those truths whic h, to a correct and unprejudiced mind, carries its own evidence along 
with it; and may be obscured, but cannot be made plainer by argument or reasoning. It rests upon 
axioms as simple as they are universal; the mean s ought to be proportioned to the end; the persons, 
 74from whose agency the attainment of any end is e xpected, ought to possess the means by which it is 
to be attained.   
 Whether there ought to be a federal government intrusted with the care of the common defence is a 
question in the first instance, open for discussion; but  the moment it is decided in the affirmative, it 
will follow that that government ought to be clothed with all the powers requisite to complete 
execution of its trust. And unless it can be shown that the circumstances which may affect the 
public safety are reducible within certain determinat e limits, unless the contrary of this position can 
be fairly and rationally disputed, it must be admitted, as a necessary consequence, that there can be 
no limitation of that authority which is to provide  for the defence and protection of the community, 
in any matter essential to its efficacy - that is, in any matter essential to the formation, direction, or 
support of the NATIONAL FORCES.   
 Defective as the present Confederation has been pr oved to be, this principle appears to have been 
fully recognized by the framers of it, though they ha ve not made proper or adequate provision for its 
exercise. Congress have an unlimited discretion to make requisitions of men and money; to govern 
the army and navy; to direct their operations. As their requisitions are made constitutionally binding 
upon the States, who are in fact under the most so lemn obligations to furnish the supplies required 
of them, the intention evidently was that the United States should command whatever resources 
where by them judged requisite to the "common de fence and general welfare." It was presumed that 
a sense of their true interests, and a regard to the dictates of good faith, would be found sufficient 
pledges for the punctual performance of the duty of the members to the federal head.   
 
The experiment has, however, demonstrated that this expectation was ill-founded and illusory; and 
the observations, made under the last head, will, I imagine, have sufficed to convince the impartial 
and discerning that there is an absolute necessity for an entire change in the first principles of the system; that if we are in earnest about giving the Union energy and duration, we must abandon the vain project of legislating upon the States in their collective capacities; we must extend the laws of 
the federal government to the individual citizens of America; we must discard the fallacious scheme 
of quotas and requisitions, as equally impracticable and unjust. The result from all this is that the 
Union ought to be invested with full power to levy troops; to build and equip fleets; and to raise the revenues which will be required for the formation and support of an army and navy, in the 
customary and ordinary modes practiced in other governments.   
 
If the circumstances of our country are such as to demand a compound instead of a simple, a 
confederate instead of a sole, government, the essent ial point which will remain to be adjusted will 
be to discriminate the OBJECTS, as far as it can be done, which shall appertain to the different 
provinces or departments of power, allowing to each the most ample authority for fulfilling the 
objects committed to its charge. Shall the Union be  constituted the guardian of the common safety? 
Are fleets and armies and revenues necessary to this purpose? The government of the Union must 
be empowered to pass all laws, and to make all regulations which have relation to them. The same 
must be the case in respect to commerce, and to every other matter to which its jurisdiction is 
permitted to extend. Is the administration of justice between the citizens of the same State the 
proper department of the local governments? These must possess all the authorities which are 
connected with this object, and with every other that may be allotted to their particular cognizance 
and direction. Not to confer in each case a degr ee of power commensurate to the end would be to 
 75violate the most obvious rules of prudence and pr opriety, and improvidently to trust the great 
interests of the nation to hands which are disabled from managing them with vigor and success.   
 Who so likely to make suitable provisions for the public defence as that body to which the 
guardianship of the public safety is confided; wh ich, as the center of information, will best 
understand the extent and urgency of the dangers that threaten; as the representative of the 
WHOLE, will feel itself most deeply interested in the preservation of every part; which, from the 
responsibility implied in the duty assigned to it, will be most sensibly impressed with the necessity of proper exertions; and which, by the extension of its authority throughout the States, can alone 
establish uniformity and concert in the plans and measures by which the common safety is to be 
secured? Is there not a manifest inconsistency in devolving upon the federal government the care of 
the general defence, and leaving in the State governments the effective powers by which it is to be 
provided for? Is not a want of co-operation the in fallible consequence of such a system? And will 
not weakness, disorder, and undue distribution of the burdens and calamities of war, an unnecessary 
and intolerable increase of expense, be its natural and inevitable concomitants? Have we not had 
unequivocal experience of its effects in the course of the revolution which we have just 
accomplished.   
 Every view we may take of the subject, as candid inquirers after truth, will serve to convince us, 
that it is both unwise and dangerous to deny the federal government and unconfined authority, as to 
all those objects which are intrusted to its management . It will indeed deserve the most vigilant and 
careful attention of the people to see that it be modelled in such a manner as to admit of its being 
safely vested with the requisite powers. If any plan which has been, or may be, offered to our 
consideration, should not, upon a dispassionate insp ection, be found to answer this description, it 
ought to be rejected. A government, the constitution of  which renders it unfit to be trusted with all 
the powers which a free people ought to delegate to any government, would be an unsafe and improper depositary of the NATIONAL INTEREST S. Wherever THESE can with propriety be 
confided, the coincident powers may safely accompany  them. This is the true result of all just 
reasoning upon the subject. And the adversaries of the plan promulgated by the convention ought to 
have confined themselves to showing, that the internal structure of the proposed government was 
such as to render it unworthy of the confidence of the people. They ought not to have wandered into inflammatory declamations and unmeaning cavils about the extent of the powers. The POWERS are 
not too extensive for the OBJECTS of federal administration, or, in other words, for the 
management of our NATIONAL INTERESTS; not can any satisfactory argument be framed to 
show that they are chargeable with such an excess. If it be true, as has been insinuated by some of 
the writers on the other side, that the difficulty ar ises from the nature of the thing, and that the 
extent of the country will not permit us to form a government in which such ample powers can 
safely be reposed, it would prove that ought to cont ract our views, and resort to the expedient of 
separate confederacies, which will move within more practicable spheres. For the absurdity must 
continually stare us in the face of confiding to a government the direction of the most essential 
national interests, without daring to trust it to the authorities which are indispensable to their proper and efficient management. Let us not attempt to reconcile contradictions, but firmly embrace a 
rational alternative.   
 
I trust, however, that the impracticability of one general system cannot be shown. I am greatly 
mistaken, if any thing of weight has yet been advanced of this tendency; and I flatter myself that the observations which have been made in the course of these papers have served to place the reverse of 
 76that position in as clear a light as any matter still in the womb of time and experience can be 
susceptible of. This, at all events, must be evident, that the very difficulty itself, drawn from the 
extent of the country, is the strongest argument in favor of an energetic government; for any other can certainly never preserve the Union of so large an empire. If we embrace the tenets of those who 
oppose the adoption of the proposed C onstitution, as the standard of our political creed, we cannot 
fail to verify the gloomy doctrines which predict the impracticability of a national system pervading 
entire limits of the present Confederacy.
